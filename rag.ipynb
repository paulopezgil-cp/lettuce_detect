Built on Subaru's proven philosophy of safety, reliability, and all-weather capability, the Outback represents the perfect vehicle for active families and outdoor enthusiasts who refuse to compromise between everyday practicality and weekend adventure readiness.\\n\\nProven Boxer Engine Technology The 2024 Outback features Subaru's renowned horizontally opposed boxer engine configuration in two displacement options. The standard 2.5-liter naturally aspirated four-cylinder engine produces 182 horsepower and 176 lb-ft of torque, providing smooth, linear power delivery that excels in both city driving and highway cruising conditions.\\n\\nFor customers requiring additional performance, the available 2.4-liter turbocharged boxer engine generates 260 horsepower and 277 lb-ft of torque. This powerplant incorporates advanced technologies including direct injection, dual active valve control system, and a sophisticated cooling system that ensures consistent performance under all operating conditions.\\n\\nThe boxer engine's unique flat configuration provides a lower center of gravity compared to traditional inline or V-type engines, enhancing vehicle stability and handling while reducing vibration for improved refinement.

The approach and departure angles are optimized for off-road use while maintaining the low step-in height that makes daily use comfortable for all family members.\\n\\nProtective body cladding and underbody skid plates shield critical components from damage during off-road adventures. The water fording depth of 21 inches allows the Outback to traverse streams and deep puddles that would challenge many traditional SUVs.\\n\\nThe sophisticated suspension system balances off-road capability with on-road comfort through carefully tuned springs and dampers that absorb road irregularities while maintaining stable handling characteristics. The suspension geometry provides excellent wheel articulation for maintaining traction on uneven surfaces.\\n\\nSpacious and Versatile Interior The 2024 Outback interior maximizes space utilization with a thoughtful layout that prioritizes passenger comfort and cargo versatility. The front seats offer excellent support with available power adjustment, heating, and ventilation features. The driving position provides excellent visibility in all directions, enhancing safety and confidence during all types of driving.\\n\\nThe rear seating area provides generous legroom and headroom for adult passengers, while the 60/40 split-folding rear seats allow for flexible cargo arrangements. With the rear seats folded, the Outback provides up to 75.7 cubic feet of cargo space, easily accommodating camping gear, sports equipment, or large household items.\\n\\nThoughtful storage solutions throughout the cabin include large door pockets, multiple cup holders, and a spacious center console. The available cargo organization system includes adjustable dividers and tie-down points for securing items during transport.\\n\\nAdvanced Safety Technologies Subaru's EyeSight Driver Assist Technology comes standard on all Outback models, providing comprehensive safety and driver assistance capabilities. This system includes pre-collision braking with pedestrian and cyclist detection, adaptive cruise control with lane centering, and lane departure warning with steering assist.\\n\\nThe EyeSight system utilizes dual color cameras mounted near the rearview mirror to provide stereoscopic vision that can accurately judge distances and identify objects in the vehicle's path. This technology continuously monitors the road ahead and can automatically apply brakes or provide steering assistance to help avoid potential collisions.\\n\\nAdditional available safety features include blind spot detection with lane change assist, rear cross-traffic alert, and reverse automatic braking. The Outback has earned the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety's Top Safety Pick+ award and a five-star overall safety rating from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\\n\\nSTARLINK Multimedia System The 2024 Outback features Subaru's STARLINK multimedia system with either an 11.6-inch or 12.3-inch touchscreen display depending on trim level. The system includes wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility, allowing seamless smartphone integration for navigation, entertainment, and communication functions.\\n\\nThe available navigation system includes real-time traffic information and points of interest data. Premium audio options include a Harman Kardon system with 12 speakers strategically positioned throughout the cabin for exceptional sound quality.\\n\\nSTARLINK connected services provide remote vehicle monitoring, emergency assistance, and stolen vehicle recovery capabilities. The system can also provide maintenance reminders and schedule service appointments with local Subaru dealers.\\n\\nOutdoor-Focused Design The Outback's design reflects its adventure-ready character with robust styling elements and functional features that support active lifestyles. The black wheel arch cladding and side body protection provide both visual appeal and practical protection against trail damage.\\n\\nAvailable roof rails and crossbars support a wide variety of cargo carriers for bikes, kayaks, skis, and cargo boxes. The power rear gate with hands-free operation makes loading and unloading cargo convenient even when hands are full.\\n\\nLED lighting throughout provides excellent visibility while creating a distinctive appearance. The available LED fog lights enhance visibility during challenging weather conditions.\\n\\nTrim Levels and Features The 2024 Outback is available in Base, Premium, Limited, Touring, and Wilderness trim levels. The base model starts at $28,895 and includes essential features like Symmetrical All-Wheel Drive, EyeSight safety technology, and the STARLINK multimedia system.\\n\\nThe Premium trim adds features like power driver's seat, heated front seats, and upgraded interior materials.

The top-tier Touring trim provides luxury amenities like ventilated front seats and navigation system.\\n\\nThe rugged Wilderness trim features enhanced off-road capability with raised suspension, unique exterior styling, and specialized all-terrain tires for maximum adventure readiness.\\n\\nEnvironmental Responsibility Subaru demonstrates environmental commitment through the Outback's efficient design and the company's zero-landfill manufacturing facilities. The vehicle achieves EPA-estimated fuel economy ratings of up to 26 mpg in the city and 35 mpg on the highway with the naturally aspirated engine.\\n\\nThe company's commitment to environmental stewardship extends to using recycled and sustainable materials in vehicle construction and maintaining carbon-neutral manufacturing facilities.\\n\\nReliability and Value The Outback benefits from Subaru's reputation for building reliable, long-lasting vehicles that retain their value over time. The comprehensive warranty includes a three-year/36,000-mile basic warranty and five-year/60,000-mile powertrain warranty.\\n\\nSubaru's extensive dealer network provides convenient service availability, while the brand's commitment to customer satisfaction ensures positive ownership experiences.
