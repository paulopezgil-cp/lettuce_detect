Subaru Outback 2024 - Adventure-Ready Wagon
The 2024 Subaru Outback continues to define the crossover wagon segment with its unique combination of SUV capability, sedan comfort, and wagon versatility. Built on Subaru's proven philosophy of safety, reliability, and all-weather capability, the Outback represents the perfect vehicle for active families and outdoor enthusiasts who refuse to compromise between everyday practicality and weekend adventure readiness.
Proven Boxer Engine Technology
The 2024 Outback features Subaru's renowned horizontally opposed boxer engine configuration in two displacement options. The standard 2.5-liter naturally aspirated four-cylinder engine produces 182 horsepower and 176 lb-ft of torque, providing smooth, linear power delivery that excels in both city driving and highway cruising conditions.
For customers requiring additional performance, the available 2.4-liter turbocharged boxer engine generates 260 horsepower and 277 lb-ft of torque. This powerplant incorporates advanced technologies including direct injection, dual active valve control system, and a sophisticated cooling system that ensures consistent performance under all operating conditions.
The boxer engine's unique flat configuration provides a lower center of gravity compared to traditional inline or V-type engines, enhancing vehicle stability and handling while reducing vibration for improved refinement. The engine layout also allows for better weight distribution and improved crash safety through the engine's ability to slide underneath the passenger compartment during frontal impacts.
Legendary Symmetrical All-Wheel Drive
Every 2024 Outback comes standard with Subaru's Symmetrical All-Wheel Drive system, which provides superior traction and stability in all weather and road conditions. Unlike many competitors' AWD systems that are primarily front-wheel drive with rear engagement when needed, Subaru's system continuously sends power to all four wheels for optimal grip and control.
The system features a sophisticated center differential that can vary power distribution between front and rear axles based on traction conditions. Advanced sensors continuously monitor wheel slip, vehicle speed, and steering input to optimize power delivery for maximum stability and control.
X-MODE functionality enhances the AWD system's capability by adjusting engine output, transmission mapping, and brake intervention for improved traction on challenging terrain including snow, mud, sand, and steep inclines. Hill Descent Control works in conjunction with X-MODE to maintain safe speeds when descending steep grades.
Exceptional Ground Clearance and Capability
The Outback's 8.7 inches of ground clearance provides genuine SUV-level capability for navigating rough roads, rocky trails, and deep snow conditions. The approach and departure angles are optimized for off-road use while maintaining the low step-in height that makes daily use comfortable for all family members.
Protective body cladding and underbody skid plates shield critical components from damage during off-road adventures. The water fording depth of 21 inches allows the Outback to traverse streams and deep puddles that would challenge many traditional SUVs.
The sophisticated suspension system balances off-road capability with on-road comfort through carefully tuned springs and dampers that absorb road irregularities while maintaining stable handling characteristics. The suspension geometry provides excellent wheel articulation for maintaining traction on uneven surfaces.
Spacious and Versatile Interior
The 2024 Outback interior maximizes space utilization with a thoughtful layout that prioritizes passenger comfort and cargo versatility. The front seats offer excellent support with available power adjustment, heating, and ventilation features. The driving position provides excellent visibility in all directions, enhancing safety and confidence during all types of driving.
The rear seating area provides generous legroom and headroom for adult passengers, while the 60/40 split-folding rear seats allow for flexible cargo arrangements. With the rear seats folded, the Outback provides up to 75.7 cubic feet of cargo space, easily accommodating camping gear, sports equipment, or large household items.
Thoughtful storage solutions throughout the cabin include large door pockets, multiple cup holders, and a spacious center console. The available cargo organization system includes adjustable dividers and tie-down points for securing items during transport.
Advanced Safety Technologies
Subaru's EyeSight Driver Assist Technology comes standard on all Outback models, providing comprehensive safety and driver assistance capabilities. This system includes pre-collision braking with pedestrian and cyclist detection, adaptive cruise control with lane centering, and lane departure warning with steering assist.
The EyeSight system utilizes dual color cameras mounted near the rearview mirror to provide stereoscopic vision that can accurately judge distances and identify objects in the vehicle's path. This technology continuously monitors the road ahead and can automatically apply brakes or provide steering assistance to help avoid potential collisions.
Additional available safety features include blind spot detection with lane change assist, rear cross-traffic alert, and reverse automatic braking. The Outback has earned the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety's Top Safety Pick+ award and a five-star overall safety rating from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.
STARLINK Multimedia System
The 2024 Outback features Subaru's STARLINK multimedia system with either an 11.6-inch or 12.3-inch touchscreen display depending on trim level. The system includes wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility, allowing seamless smartphone integration for navigation, entertainment, and communication functions.
The available navigation system includes real-time traffic information and points of interest data. Premium audio options include a Harman Kardon system with 12 speakers strategically positioned throughout the cabin for exceptional sound quality.
STARLINK connected services provide remote vehicle monitoring, emergency assistance, and stolen vehicle recovery capabilities. The system can also provide maintenance reminders and schedule service appointments with local Subaru dealers.
Outdoor-Focused Design
The Outback's design reflects its adventure-ready character with robust styling elements and functional features that support active lifestyles. The black wheel arch cladding and side body protection provide both visual appeal and practical protection against trail damage.
Available roof rails and crossbars support a wide variety of cargo carriers for bikes, kayaks, skis, and cargo boxes. The power rear gate with hands-free operation makes loading and unloading cargo convenient even when hands are full.
LED lighting throughout provides excellent visibility while creating a distinctive appearance. The available LED fog lights enhance visibility during challenging weather conditions.
