    "\n",
    "LettuceDetect is a new lightweight, open-source framework designed to identify hallucinations in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "This framework addresses two critical limitations of existing methods by utilizing ModernBERT's extended context capabilities and being significantly more computationally efficient than comparable Large Language Model (LLM)-based approaches:\n",
    "- Context window constraints of traditional encoder-based methods\n",
    "\n",
    "- Computational inefficiency of LLM-based approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluated on the RAGTruth benchmark dataset, LettuceDetect outperforms previous encoder-based models and most prompt-based models in detecting unsupported claims at a token level."
